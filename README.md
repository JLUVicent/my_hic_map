HiCzin: Normalizing metagenomic Hi-C data and detecting spurious contacts using zero-inflated negative binomial regression

## Source of biases in metagenomic Hi-C experiments
In addition to chromosomal contacts of interests, several other factors unrelated to chromosomal contacts can influence the number of Hi-C interactions between contigs. We refer to such factors as biases. Two kinds of biases with substantial influences on metagenomic Hi-C contact maps were reported: explicit biases and implicit biases. Explicit biases include three potential factors: the number of enzymatic restriction sites on contigs, the length and the coverage of contigs. Implicit biases contain unobserved interactions and spurious inter-species contacts. Unobserved interactions mean that some chimerical DNA fragments are missed due to the factors such as mappability of contigs and in vivo constraints on accessibility. Spurious inter-species contacts arise from the ligation of DNA fragments between closely related species.
